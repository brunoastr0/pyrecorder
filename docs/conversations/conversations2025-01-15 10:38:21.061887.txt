It appears to be a conversation about food orders in a restaurant. Here's a brief summary:

1. The customer wants a pizza made with "caíso" only.
2. The seller reassures the customer by recapping his order: Two family-size pizzas, one of them only with "caíso". The other pizza toppings include green toppings, green olives, chicken and tomato.
3. The seller then asks about the type of drink the customer wants. The options available are Cocacola, Sprite, orange juice, apple juice, or beer.
4. The client asks for a beverage called "sumedgurana", but the waiter informs him they do not have this drink, as they are in Portugal and not in Brazil. 
5. The client then asks for "G-G-G-R-E-L", but this is also not available.

Note: Certain terms like "caíso", "sumedgurana" and "G-G-G-R-E-L" are not clear. The transcription seems to be possibly involve language dialect or possibly mistakes in dictation. Please provide correct terms if possible.
