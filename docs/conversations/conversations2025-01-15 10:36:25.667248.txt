This is the important information gathered from the conversation:

The customer has ordered from a variety of pizza options available at the restaurant. 

1. The customer initially wanted a pizza with tomato toppings only, but then changed the order to a cheese pizza.
2. The customer does not want any other toppings except cheese on their pizza.
3. The customer had a complimentary pizza available, which was made clear to them.
4. The actual paid order includes two family-sized pizzas.
5. One of the pizzas is just cheese (this one is the free one), and the other one consists of green toppings, green olives, chicken, and tomatoes.
6. The customer also ordered beverages, specifically any type of cola and orange and apple "Sunder" (possibly a brand or type of juice).
  
This seems to be the customer's final order.
