From the interaction, this is the important information gathered:

1. The customer has placed an order for two pizzas.
2. One of the pizzas is simply cheese (ca√≠so). 
3. The customer is in a hurry (wants to dispatch this).
4. The other pizza comes with toppings including green pepper (compinente verde), green olive (azeitona verde), chicken (frango), and tomato.
5. The seller also asked if the customer would like to add any drinks to the order.
  
Please note that some specific details (like "Duas pisas milhares") might have been misspelled or misunderstood, and therefore it's difficult for me to interpret them properly.
