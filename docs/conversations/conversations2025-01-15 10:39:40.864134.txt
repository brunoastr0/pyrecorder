From the interaction, the important information is as follows:

1. The customer has ordered a meal which includes 'compimento verde' (green seasoning), green olives, chicken, and tomato.
2. The seller asks if the customer would like a drink to accompany their meal and offers Coca-Cola, Sprite, Sondaranja (Orange Juice), Sondarmaçã (Apple Juice), beer, or Guaraná juice. However, they're out of Basil, which is a popular seasoning in Portugal.
3. The seller doesn't have 'Gengeral' either.
4. The customer initially wants a 'Súme de Roma' (Pomegranate Juice), but the seller only offers orange or apple juice.
5. The customer changes their mind and does not want juice anymore but hasn't specified what they do want instead. 

Please note these points need further clarification due to language barriers and potential misspellings in the conversation.
